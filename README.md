## About

This library was made as a replacement for qLib and in the future cubed. These 2 plugins are hard to get you hands on and one of them has many outdated methods so this is a more modern version of those things. Of course, I have to give credit where credit is due so I used some ideas from cubed & NV6 so thank you for being awsome :)
